                        <li>Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.</li>
                        <li>In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[39] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. 
                        </li>
                        <li>n 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well</li>
                        <li>Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[58] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.[44] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.[58] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.</li>
                        <li>1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck.[63] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.[64] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea,</li>
